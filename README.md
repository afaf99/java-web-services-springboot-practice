# Web Services with Spring Boot - Practice Project

This repository contains practice code and examples from the course **"Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot"**. Through this project, I explored the fundamentals of designing and developing both SOAP and RESTful web services using Spring Boot, focusing on industry best practices, database integration, and essential Spring Boot features.

## What You'll Learn

In this project, you'll find implementations and practices covering:

- **SOAP & RESTful Web Services**  
  - Designed and developed SOAP and RESTful web services using the Spring Boot framework.
  - Applied best practices in RESTful web service design to create scalable and maintainable APIs.

- **Spring Boot Essentials**  
  - Utilized Spring Boot features like auto-configuration, Spring Initializr, and starter projects to streamline web service development.

- **Database Integration**  
  - Connected web services to a database using JPA and Hibernate with Spring Boot, enabling efficient data persistence.

- **Advanced RESTful Features**  
  - Implemented Exception Handling, Validation, HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State), and Filtering to enhance RESTful web services.

- **Spring Boot Starter Projects**  
  - Explored a variety of Spring Boot starter projects, including Spring Boot Web, Web Services, and Data JPA to simplify application setup.

- **Versioning, Monitoring & Documentation**  
  - Practiced RESTful web service versioning, monitoring using Spring Boot Actuator, and documenting APIs with Swagger.

- **SOAP Standards**  
  - Gained an understanding of WSDL, SOAP Header, SOAP Body, SOAP Fault, XSD, JAXB, and EndPoint configuration for SOAP-based web services.
